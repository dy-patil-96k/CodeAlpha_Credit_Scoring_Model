## 📌 Objective  
Predict an individual's **creditworthiness** using historical financial data and **Logistic Regression**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Features  
- **Data preprocessing** and **feature engineering** from financial records  
- Developed a **Logistic Regression** model  
- Evaluated model using:
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **ROC-AUC**
- Visualized feature correlations and model performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset  
A structured dataset containing:
- Age
- Gender             
- Education          
- Income             
- Debt               
- Credit_Score       
- Loan_Amount        
- Loan_Term          
- Number_Of_Credit_Cards   
- Payment_History    
- Employment_Status  
- Residence_Type     
- Marital_Status     
- Creditworthiness(lebel/target)


## ✅ Outcome  
Achieved a working and interpretable credit scoring model using **Logistic Regression**, capable of classifying individuals based on credit risk factors.
